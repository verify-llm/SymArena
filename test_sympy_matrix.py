    SymPy has MatrixSymbol and Matrix sorts.
    
    MatrixSymbol represent matrix as one symbol.
    MatrixSymbol can scale without side effect (see zoom=1xxxx).
    
    Matrix is concrete matrix with elements to be number or symbolics.
    So its scalability is almost the same as e.g. np.ndarray with Symbol elements.
    
    MatrixSymbol can only represent 2-D matrix, and support basic matrix operations.
    These factors provides insufficient support for LLM representations.
